//   1. (version 1)
//   2. (deny default)              -- everything is denied unless named
//   3. prerequisites               -- dyld cache, /dev/null, bootstrap port
//   4. filesystem grants           -- shallow to deep
//   5. filesystem DENIALS          -- after grants, so a deny inside a granted
//                                     subtree actually wins
//   6. network
//   7. process ops
//
// get 4 and 5 backwards and a `(deny file-write* (subpath "/etc"))` under an
// `(allow file-write* (subpath "/"))` silently does nothing.

// with EPERM. A caller reads that as "the sandbox is broken" rather than "the
// grant never applied", because every other grant in the same profile works.
//
// Emitting BOTH spellings is deliberate rather than emitting only the
// resolved one: the resolved path is what the kernel matches, and the
// original is kept so a human reading the profile sees the path they asked
// for. Neither grants anything the other does not -- they are the same
// directory under two names.

// must produce the same profile on a CI runner as on the target mac, and

    // -- process operations -------------------------------------------------
    //
    // ProcOps is NOT consulted to decide fork/exec, and that asymmetry is
    // deliberate rather than an oversight.
    //
    // On linux, `ProcOps` is advisory: src/plan/compile.cpp never reads it,
    // because fork and exec are governed by the SYSCALL PROFILE there --
    // `profiles::compiler()` permits clone/execve, `profiles::base()` does
    // not. A caller who built a working linux policy therefore has a default-
    // constructed (empty) ProcOps and a profile that allows forking.
    //
    // Reading that empty ProcOps here as "deny fork, deny exec" turned every
    // such policy into a sandbox where `/bin/sh -c` dies on its first
    // subshell with "fork: Operation not permitted" -- the same policy,
    // silently stricter on one platform.
    //
    // So an EMPTY ProcOps means "unspecified", not "deny everything", and the
    // denial is opt-in: a caller who sets any proc op at all is stating an
    // intent, and the ones they left out are then genuinely withheld. The
    // lattice cannot distinguish "unset" from "bottom" for us, so this is the
    // one place that distinction has to be made by hand.

        // which `/bin/sh -c 'a && b'` dies on its first subshell.
