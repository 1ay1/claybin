// claybin: a minimal spawn, for tests and for callers with no event loop.
//
// deliberately small. it forks, applies the plan, and execs. it does NOT
// supervise: no timeout, no output pumping, no reaping strategy. that is the
// loop's job (see docs/jaal.md), and claybin refuses to grow one.
//
// the one thing it does own is the fork/exec boundary itself, because that is
// where the async-signal-safety rules live and they are easy to get wrong.

    // and bubblewrap leaks one here. but a caller that wants the guest's output
    // needs a pipe to survive that, so it has to be declared rather than
    // assumed.
    //
    // this is libminijail's minijail_preserve_fd(j, parent_fd, child_fd), and
    // the shape is worth copying rather than inventing: the CALLER owns the
    // descriptor and says where it should land, so the ordering hazard of
    // dup2-ing onto a number that is still in use is handled in one place
    // instead of at every call site. it is also the piece that lets an embedder
    // keep its own supervise loop -- poll the read end, reap the pid -- which is
    // the difference between a library and a subprocess.
    //
    // a pair is applied as dup2(parent_fd, child_fd) in the child, after the
